Contributing to EFDC-MPI

Adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions. Furthermore, if you are publishing a new study using EFDC-MPI, we encourage you to consider linking it to the repo so that others may use for their research or teaching needs.

Bug fixes can be initiated through Github pull requests. When making code contributions to EFDC-MPI, we ask that you follow the PEP 8 coding standard and that you provide unit tests for the new features.
